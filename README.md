## Visual Design

### Wireframes

This website's pages were designed in Balsamiq Wireframes following the principles of mobile-first design. The wireframes were initially structured for mobile devices to prioritize usability and functionality on smaller screens. This approach helps ensure that the website is accessible and user-friendly across various devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.

The wireframes underwent multiple iterations and refinements to fine-tune the layout, navigation, and visual elements. Feedback from stakeholders and usability testing were incorporated into the design process to optimize the overall user experience.

By incorporating both mobile and desktop designs into the wireframes, the website's development process facilitated responsive design and enables the website to adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions, delivering a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across all devices.
